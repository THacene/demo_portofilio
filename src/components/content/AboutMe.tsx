        About Me
      </h2>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>{siteConfig.author}</strong>, I've been passionate about coding since I was a child.
         I fell in love with programming at a young age, 
         spending countless hours learning, experimenting, 
         and creating small projects. Over the years, this passion has grown into a career as a Web Developer, 
         Backend Developer, and System Security Administrator, where I continue to build innovative solutions and ensure secure,
        efficient systems that solve real-world problems.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
       As Iâ€™ve evolved in my career, Iâ€™ve expanded my expertise into areas like advanced web development,
        system Administrator, and cybersecurity, 
        diving deep into designing efficient infrastructures and implementing strong security measures.
         But no matter how much I learn, I always keep that same excitement and curiosity I had as a child,
          exploring new fields and technologies that push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
        Today, Iâ€™m not just focused on building apps and websites; Iâ€™m also
        exploring DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to optimize and
        scale my projects. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and Iâ€™m
        always looking for new challenges that help me expand my skills.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
        If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on something exciting or need help
        with a project, feel free to reach out. Letâ€™s create something amazing
        together!
